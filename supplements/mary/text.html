         <p>
            Mary the mother of Jesus is an important and controversial figure in the Christian
            Bible and the Qur’an.
            All Christians and Muslims believe Mary gave birth to Jesus miraculously as a virgin,
            but the agreement ends there.
            The Qur’an gives more centrality to Mary than the Christian Bible, for example in
            the total number of mentions and by tracing the genealogy of Jesus through Mary rather
            than Joseph.
            Yet while Christians believe that Mary is the mother of God, it is important for Muslims
            that Jesus was an exclusively human prophet who taught the same monotheism as the
            prophet Muhammed.
            Within Christianity, Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Christians place more emphasis
            on Mary than Protestant Christians.
            At least in North America, it is highly probable that a person named Mary or Maria
            comes from a Catholic family, and an institution named after Mary or one of her titles
            (St. Mary’s, Notre Dame, Our Lady of the Lake / Sea / Harbor, Immaculate Conception, etc.) was historically named by Catholics.
            Not all Catholics choose to emphasize Mary to the same degree, and not all Protestants
            have the same degree of aversion, but a general pattern is clear.
            The following will discuss first the story of Mary in the New Testament, on which
            all Christians agree.
            Next, traditions not clearly stated in scripture will explain the ongoing significance
            of Mary for Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Christians.
            From there we will turn to one particular devotee of Mary, William Joseph Chaminade,
            and the other founders of the Marianists, who in turn founded St. Mary’s University
            in San Antonio.

         <h2>2. The Story of Mary of Nazareth in the New Testament</h2>
         <p>
            Most of what Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Christians believe about Mary is not clearly
            stated in the New Testament.
            What is stated of her role in the story of God’s salvation through her son Jesus does
            not necessarily emphasize her centrality or continuing significance for Christians.
            The earliest Christian writer, Paul, never mentions Mary.
            The earliest story of the life of Jesus, the Gospel of Mark, does not mention the
            birth or infancy of Jesus.
            Mark does name Mary as the mother of Jesus, but also names <span class="greek">ἀδελφοὶ</span> “brothers.”
            A later version of the story of Jesus, the Gospel of Matthew, states that Mary was
            a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus.
            Matthew’s emphasis is on the miraculous life of Jesus and fulfillment of scriptures,
            in this case the prophecy of Isaiah that a virgin will conceive and bear a son.
            The important early principle that Jesus fulfills the scriptures of Israel is discussed
            in 
            						<i>Theological Questions</i> 
            						“<a href="https://thanneken.github.io/TheologicalQuestions/derivatives/TheologicalQuestions.html#index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.3_div.7">fulfills the Scriptures</a>.”
            Mark and Matthew will leave it to later Christians to debate whether Jesus had full
            (both parents) siblings, that is, whether Mary remained a virgin after giving birth
            to Jesus.
            Besides the miraculous birth, Matthew’s gospel also describes Mary, Joseph, and Jesus
            fleeing to Egypt while Herod massacred children.
            Again, the original audience was more interested in ways that the life of Jesus parallels
            the story of Israel in fulfillment of the scriptures.
            Readers in our own time have heard the story of the holy family as refugees as a challenge
            to us to think more compassionately about refugees today.

         <p class="firstindent">
            The earliest Christian writing to pay extended attention to Mary is the Gospel of
            Luke along with its sequel, the Acts of the Apostles.
            Luke makes Mary more than a passive vehicle of God’s salvation, portraying her making
            a choice when challenged by the angel Gabriel.
            Luke also relates Mary’s visit to Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, and the
            composition of the hymn called the Magnificat.
            The Acts of the Apostles places Mary present among the apostles at Pentecost when
            the Holy Spirit begins to act among the followers of Jesus.
            Although Mary is not mentioned after the first chapter of the Acts of the Apostles,
            later interpreters will find great significance in her presence.
            The story of Pentecost can be thought of as the beginning, or birth, of the church.
            In other early Christian writings, the church is called the body of Christ.
            Interpreters will expand on the parallel between Mary as conceiver, gestator, birth-giver,
            and nurturer of the literal incarnate body of Christ as well as the mystical body
            of Christ, the church.
            All Christians can agree on what is clearly stated in the New Testament, but the New
            Testament does not make clear whether Mary’s significance is limited to the events
            of two thousand years ago, or continues to be relevant to the faith lives of all Christians
            in the ongoing present.
            
         </p>
         <p class="firstindent">
            The most recent Gospel in the New Testament, John, includes Mary not just at the birth
            of Jesus but among the followers of Jesus after his death.
            According to John, Jesus, while dying on the cross, entrusts Mary to John and John
            to Mary.
            John also portrays Mary as the first to teach others to follow Jesus while attending
            a wedding at Cana.
            Also attributed to John is the last book of the Christian bible, the Apocalypse of
            John also called the book of Revelation.
            The woman who gives birth is not called Mary and need not be interpreted as Mary.
            She could represent the church, which would still fit the interpretation of Mary as
            mother of the Church.
            We may never know how the author and first audience understood the strange vision
            in Revelation 12.
            We can safely say that John’s audience understood Mary to be the mother of Jesus,
            an exemplary follower of Jesus, and related to the community at its founding.
            We can as safely say that her role does not rival that of Jesus in frequency of mention
            or significance of claims.
            Later Christians will decide for themselves how much significance Mary continues to
            play in the faith lives of the followers of her son.

         <h2>3. Mary in Interpretations and Early Tradition</h2>
         <p>
            Three titles or claims about Mary illustrate three fundamental differences in how
            Christians think, not just about Mary, but about fundamental questions of how we think
            about faith.
            Those differences largely correlate with differences between Catholic and Protestant
            Christians, but also vary within each community and across time.
            The claim that Mary was eternally without sin illustrates the claim by Catholics that
            traditions outside of scripture can be reliable sources 
            						(Scripture and Tradition).
            The claim that Mary is the mother of the church illustrates the Catholic belief that
            exemplary Christians who are now dead continue to be part of our faith lives 
            						(Communion of the Saints).
            The claim that Mary is the Queen of Heaven illustrates the belief 
            						(less clearly divided between all Catholics and all Protestants) 
            						that advocacy from others can add meaningfully to our individual merits for
            purposes of divine judgment 
            						(intercession).

         <div id="div3-1">
            <h3>3.1. Eternally Virgin and Without Sin</h3>
            <p>
               The New Testament claims that Mary was a virgin when she conceived and gave birth
               to Jesus.
               The New Testament also refers to the “brothers” of Jesus, which could refer to full
               (both parents) siblings or other literal or figurative family members.
               The authors in the New Testament did not clarify that question.
               The tradition that Mary was <span class="defaultHi">eternally virgin</span> even after giving birth to Jesus (and thus that Jesus had no full siblings) goes
               back to the Proto-Gospel of James.
               The Proto-Gospel of James narrates much of the story of the life of Mary, starting
               with her parents.
               It is approximately as old as the formation of the New Testament, but was not included
               in the New Testament.
               The exclusion could just mean that it was viewed as secondary in importance to the
               four gospels about Jesus, not necessarily as false.
               The book and many of its core ideas (including the eternal virginity of Mary) were
               handed down by Christians for centuries.
               Catholics believe that we know God both through scripture and through traditions such
               as these passed down for generations in our church and communities 
               							(<span class="defaultHi">Scripture and Tradition</span>).
               Protestants, starting with Martin Luther in the sixteenth century, assert that Scripture
               is in a class by itself as God’s revelation (<span class="defaultHi">Sola Scriptura</span>).
               Most Protestants accept many traditions outside of scripture, such as celebrating
               the birth of Jesus on December 25, as secondary and acceptable only if they do not
               contradict scripture.
               If one is only reading scripture and not considering traditions, it is very reasonable
               to conclude that Jesus did have full siblings, or at least that the New Testament
               authors had no interest in teaching us to believe otherwise.
               When Protestants assert that Mary did not remain a virgin, they are expressing a theological
               principle of the exclusive centrality of scripture.
               The views of “Scripture and Tradition” versus “Scripture Alone” are discussed in 
               							<i>Theological Questions</i>, 
               							“<a href="https://thanneken.github.io/TheologicalQuestions/derivatives/TheologicalQuestions.html#index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.2">Whom do you trust with big decisions?</a>”
               
            </p>
            <p class="firstindent">
               Along with the belief that Mary remained eternally virgin is the belief that Mary
               remained eternally <span class="defaultHi">without sin</span>.
               The reasoning here was partly that the most holy God could not be gestated in a sinful
               body, so Mary must have been without sin.
               The reasoning also seems to be related to a belief among many early Christians, including
               Augustine, that sex cannot be separated from lust and sin.
               Augustine also articulated the belief that all humans are conceived with sin through
               sex and ultimately from our ancestors, the original sinners, Adam and Eve.
               This led to the belief that original sin was miraculously blocked when Mary was conceived
               by her mother.
               This conception without sin (Immaculate Conception) is honored by Catholics on December
               8 and is not to be confused with the annunciation and conception of Jesus on March
               25 (nine months before the traditional date of the birth of Jesus).
               The belief that God makes it possible for people (women and men) to be freed of sin
               is an important concept for Christianity.
               Augustine’s view of sexuality as sinful is open to reconsideration by Christians today.

            <p>
               The New Testament at least implies that Mary was present among the earliest communities
               of the followers of Jesus after his time on earth.
               The New Testament also makes it easy to conclude that 
               							if Mary conceived, gestated, birthed, and nurtured the literal body of Christ,
               
               							and the church is the mystical body of Christ, 
               							then Mary is in that way the mother who conceives, gestates, births, and nurtures
               the church.
               One could stop there and conclude that Mary’s significance for the church is limited
               to the first century.
               From that perspective, once the important teachings for faith were written (what became
               the New Testament), Christians need only scripture to nurture their faith lives.
               Protestant Christians tend to focus on an individual’s personal relationship with
               Christ as known through Scripture.
               Catholic Christians add to (or complicate) this focus, not only by placing Tradition
               together with Scripture (as above).
               Catholic teaching also focuses on <span class="defaultHi">community more than the individual</span>.
               This general pattern is not absolute.
               Protestants do have communities that foster faith in each other, and Catholics do
               believe the individual is responsible for important choices.
               As a matter of general emphasis and priority, however, one can say that Catholic Christians
               put more emphasis on community and most Protestant Christians place more emphasis
               on in individual’s personal relationship with God.
               This difference can be seen in views of Mary’s ongoing relationship to followers of
               Jesus today, and more broadly the concept of the Communion of Saints.
               
            </p>
            <p class="firstindent">
               The <span class="defaultHi">Communion of Saints</span> is the Catholic belief that Mary along with other role models, ancestors, friends,
               and family members are still meaningful parts of our faith community even after they
               are dead.
               We can pray with them and for them, and they can pray for us.
               While Catholics would emphasize that we pray with Mary and other ancestors, not to
               them, Protestants more emphasize that God alone should be in our prayers.
               Praying with and for other people, especially if they are dead, can be seen to distract
               from exclusive focus on a personal relationship with God.
               Some Protestant Christians view the problem as worse than poor focus, and more like
               idolatry in as much as praying with people other than God resembles praying to people
               other than God.

               The New Testament never mentions the death of Mary.
               For Orthodox and Catholic Christians, at the end of her earthly life she was taken
               up (assumed) into heaven, both body and soul (<span class="defaultHi">the assumption</span>).
               While other Christians are waiting for the second coming of Christ and resurrection
               of the body before we can be fully (body and soul) with God, Mary is ahead of us.
               On one level, this could just be a rational answer to the question of what might one
               expect to happen to someone who was without sin.
               The more important implications concern not just what happened almost two millennia
               ago, but where is Mary now and what can she do.
               The title <span class="defaultHi">“Queen of Heaven”</span> is entangled with the political, gender, and power assumptions of Christians of centuries
               past.
               It does not merely connote reward for a life well lived, but an ongoing position of
               authority, even if subordinate to an implied male counterpart, the king.
               Christians today can find theological insight more relevant than the cultural assumptions
               and metaphors of the past.
               Christians differ in our experiences of how and with whom we can relate.
               Some find it easier to relate to a woman, even if the ultimate goal is to relate better
               to her son.
               Catholicism expresses this idea through the idea of patron saints of nationalities
               and professions 
               							(see <i>Theological Questions</i>
               							“<a href="https://thanneken.github.io/TheologicalQuestions/derivatives/TheologicalQuestions.html#index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.2_div.2">Citizenship in the Roman Empire and Medieval Europe</a>”).
               The controversy is only partly whether it can be helpful to relate to people besides
               God as a means to relating to God.

            <p class="firstindent">
               The sharper controversy is <span class="defaultHi">intercession</span>, whether people besides God can advocate for us in a way that might compensate for
               our personal shortcomings.
               This controversy is less a division between Catholic and Protestant Christians, and
               more a manifestation of the universal tension between desire for justice (that which
               is deserved) and desire for mercy (that which is better than deserved).
               Part of us wants to earn a job based on our own knowledge and skills, while part of
               us wonders if a connection through a family member, friend, fellow alumnus or fraternity/sorority
               member might land us a job better than we deserve.
               Part of me trusts in God’s mercy, Christ’s salvation, and my efforts to cultivate
               faith in my life such that I may do well when judged by my creator after death.
               Part of me wants to ask for all the help I can get.
               When I ask Mary to “pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death,” I am expressing
               belief that my community, including Mary, can help me in life and afterlife.
               Others, (perhaps more so but not exclusively Protestant), could respond that I should
               not rely on Mary for something as important as the afterlife.
               Catholics agree that Christ, not Mary, saves us, but the difference is whether focus
               on Mary detracts from focus on Christ or leads to Christ.
               One could see devotion as a limited resource, such that allocating devotion to Mary
               diminishes devotion to God.
               The role of intercession intersects with <i>Theological Questions</i> 
               						“<a href="https://thanneken.github.io/TheologicalQuestions/derivatives/TheologicalQuestions.html#index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.3">What do I have to do to be saved?</a>”

            <p class="firstindent">
               The title “Queen of Heaven,” like the other titles, lends itself to confusion as to
               the status of Mary relative to God.
               Official Christian theology maintains that Mary is mother of God, not herself God.
               Mary is without sin, but not the savior who defeats sin and death.
               Mary is the mother of the church, but only Christ is head of the church.
               Mary is the Queen of Heaven, but not the King or judge.
               Official Catholic teaching believes these distinctions can be made clearly, whereas
               some Protestant teaching suggests they are in danger of blurring.

         <h2>4. The Founders of the Marianists</h2>
         <p>
            The Daughters of Mary Immaculate and Society of Mary <span class="defaultHi">(the Marianists)</span> began as an endeavor to understand Christian faith in a changing world following
            the 1789 French Revolution.
            The French Revolution can be thought of as the replacement of the French monarchy
            with the French republic.
            Along with King Louis XVI, the clergy of the Catholic Church benefitted from the former
            social structure and were in conflict with the revolution.
            William Joseph Chaminade sought to preserve the Catholic faith without the political
            and social power structure.
            He resisted the revolutionaries mostly when it came to protecting non-political small
            faith communities.
            He embraced the revolutionaries in the three-part motto of Liberty, Equality, and
            Family/Fraternity.
            More so than other Catholic religious movements and orders, the Marianists strive
            for <span class="defaultHi">equality</span> among priests, brothers, sisters, and ordinary people in the community.

         <p class="firstindent">
            The decision to name the movement the Society of Mary (which could also be translated
            as Friends of Mary) reflects the judgment of Chaminade of what kind of church was
            needed at that time.
            David Fleming, former Superior General of the Society of Mary, describes how a Marian
            church differs from a Petrine or Pauline church.
            Peter represents the institutional church with a pope, understood as a successor of
            Peter, as the center.
            Paul represents the missionary church who seeks to spread Christianity through proselytizing
            and converting.
            Mary, according to Fleming, represents the <span class="defaultHi">nurturing church</span>.
            She gave birth to the body of Christ, understood as the Church, without claiming power
            structures or opposing others.
            Chaminade thought Catholic faith could be nurtured in ordinary people in the (relative)
            absence of official structures and direct confrontation with revolutionaries who wanted
            to make the secular state central in the lives of the people.
            
         </p>
         <p class="firstindent">
            The early work of William Joseph Chaminade, Adèle de Batz de Trenquelléon, and Marie-Thérèse
            Charlotte de Lamourous focused on two major contributions.
            The first were <span class="defaultHi">sodalities</span>, small groups of ordinary people with minimal organization beyond creating a place
            to share faith.
            The second major contribution focused on <span class="defaultHi">education</span>.
            In the long struggle to establish order in France, many revolutionaries were torn
            between two principles.
            They wanted education for ordinary people.
            Chaminade attracted many to join the Society so they could train and serve as teachers.
            Many revolutionaries also distrusted any structures associated with the Catholic Church
            and wanted teachers who were independent of religious authority.
            Preferably, they would be atheists and teach atheism, or at least secularism in which
            faith is kept personal and secondary to obligations to government and public society.
            Where the Society once filled a gap in French society in the need for teachers, teachers
            committed to public faith were later not welcome in France.
            One option was to pack the bags and travel to where education and formation in faith
            were welcome, places such as Texas in 1852.

         <h2>5. St. Mary’s University in San Antonio</h2>
         <p>
            Members of the Society of Mary were active in the work of education in San Antonio
            starting in 1852.
            It is a slight exaggeration to say that St. Mary’s University was founded as early
            as that.
            Nevertheless, when the time did come to establish a college, the choice to name it
            St. Mary’s was meaningful on several levels.
            Certainly the name reflected the “brand” of its founders, the Society of Mary.
            The idea of patronage may also have been at work.
            When one names something after a powerful person with copious resources (such as the
            Bill Greehey School of Business), 
            						one is not only honoring past contributions but hoping for continued patronage
            to maintain quality worthy of the name.
            No doubt the most important factor, however, is the association in Catholic tradition
            of Mary with wisdom and knowledge.
            In the New Testament, the angel Gabriel greets Mary as “full of grace.”
            Grace in the theological sense does not mean serenity, but all the gifts of God, such
            as those listed in Isaiah: 
            						wisdom, understanding, counsel, strength, knowledge, and fear of God (Isaiah
            11:2).
            Although literacy rates for girls in rural Galilee were historically quite low, scenes
            of the Annunciation in Christian art always portray Mary as reading.
            Furthermore, she gave birth to Christ, understood in Christianity as wisdom itself
            described cryptically as early as the book of Proverbs in ancient Israel.
            Some people today might throw out names like Albert Einstein and Leonardo Da Vinci
            if they want to evoke intelligence, but <span class="defaultHi">Mary is the traditional seat of wisdom</span> in Christianity.
            The “brand” of St. Mary’s University is what we want for our students, namely theological
            literacy, wisdom, knowledge, and all the gifts of God.
